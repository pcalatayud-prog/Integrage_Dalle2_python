# DALL-E 2.0 Image Generation
This repository contains Python code for generating images using DALL-E 2.0, a state-of-the-art language-to-image synthesis model developed by OpenAI. The code takes a prompt as input and generates n images based on that prompt, which are saved automatically in a folder named after the first characters of the prompt.

## What is DALL-E 2.0?
DALL-E 2.0 is a powerful language-to-image synthesis model that can generate highly realistic images from textual descriptions. It was developed by OpenAI and builds upon the original DALL-E model, which was introduced in 2021.

## How to Use the Code
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

## Clone this repository to your local machine.
Set up your OpenAI API credentials. You'll need to provide your API key to authenticate your requests to the API. Refer to the OpenAI API documentation for more information on how to do this.
Run the generate_images.py script with the desired prompt and number of images to generate. For example:

## Example
There is an example where 5 images are created using dalle2. All these pictures are saved in a folder inside of photos.

## How to run

you can specify a prompt for generating an image with DALL-E 2.0 by defining the variable <PROMT>
You  can select the number of pictures you want to be created in the variable <itera>
